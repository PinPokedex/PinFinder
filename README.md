# PinFinder
This is a tool for recognizing images of pins and referring users to the relevant pin page.


Keywords: 
  Pin = Enamel Pin, made of metal and covered in colored enamel made by various artists and distributed widely
  LE = Limited Edition, the number of pins in the particular run
  Variant = The same design with a different set of colors on it. 
  Set = All the color variants of a pin design form a set.

-IDEA BREAKDOWN-

Essentially, the idea is that a user will be able to take a picture of a pin, or upload an image of a pin and be directed though image recognition to a page with professional photos of the pin.
  On this landing page they will find:
    1. Professional Pictures of the pin
    2. Artist Information, Name of Pin, LE and Value
    3. Link to a market listing for this pin

Besides being an informational resource for pins, the app will also function as a marketplace. From the pin information page, you can be linked to the marketplace for that pin where sellers list their pin, its condition, and price. Ideally, it would function as an auction house with bidding and/or an optional buy it now price.

I'm also curious about how to do buyer & seller protections, but this may be out of the scope of the app and it might just be best to use Paypal's payment system and therefore only buyer protections.
